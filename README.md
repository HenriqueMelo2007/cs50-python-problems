## 📁LINES_OF_CODE (problem set 6)

One way to measure the complexity of a program is to count its number of lines of code (LOC), excluding blank lines and comments. For instance, a program like

```python
# Say hello

name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"hello, {name}")
```

has just two lines of code, not four, since its first line is a comment, and its second line is blank (i.e., just whitespace). That’s not that many, so odds are the program isn’t that complex. Of course, just because a program (or even function) has more lines of code than another doesn’t necessarily mean it’s more complex. For instance, a function like

```python
def is_even(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

isn’t really twice as complex as a function like

```python
def is_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0
```

even though the former has (more than) twice as many lines of code. In fact, the former might arguably be simpler if it’s easier to read! So lines of code should be taken with a grain of salt.

Even so, in a file called `lines.py`, implement a program that expects exactly one command-line argument, the name (or path) of a Python file, and outputs the number of lines of code in that file, excluding comments and blank lines. If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, or if the specified file’s name does not end in .py, or if the specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via sys.exit.

Assume that any line that starts with #, optionally preceded by whitespace, is a comment. (A docstring should not be considered a comment.) Assume that any line that only contains whitespace is blank.

## 📁LITTLE_PROFESSOR (problem set 4)

One of David’s first toys as a child, funny enough, was Little Professor, a “calculator” that would generate ten different math problems for David to solve. For instance, if the toy were to display 4 + 0 = , David would (hopefully) answer with 4. If the toy were to display 4 + 1 = , David would (hopefully) answer with 5. If David were to answer incorrectly, the toy would display EEE. And after three incorrect answers for the same problem, the toy would simply display the correct answer (e.g., 4 + 0 = 4 or 4 + 1 = 5).

In a file called `professor.py`, implement a program that:

- Prompts the user for a level, `n`. If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program should prompt again.
- Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as `X + Y = `, wherein each of `X` and `Y` is a non-negative integer with `n` digits. No need to support operations other than addition (+).
- Prompts the user to solve each of those problems. If an answer is not correct (or not even a number), the program should output `EEE` and prompt the user again, allowing the user up to three tries in total for that problem. If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries, the program should output the correct answer.
- The program should ultimately output the user’s score: the number of correct answers out of 10.

## 📁FUEL_GAUGE (problem set 3)

Fuel gauges indicate, often with fractions, just how much fuel is in a tank. For instance 1/4 indicates that a tank is 25% full, 1/2 indicates that a tank is 50% full, and 3/4 indicates that a tank is 75% full.

In a file called `fuel.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a fraction, formatted as X/Y, wherein each of X and Y is an integer, and then outputs, as a percentage rounded to the nearest integer, how much fuel is in the tank. If, though, 1% or less remains, output E instead to indicate that the tank is essentially empty. And if 99% or more remains, output F instead to indicate that the tank is essentially full.

If, though, X or Y is not an integer, X is greater than Y, or Y is 0, instead prompt the user again. (It is not necessary for Y to be 4.) Be sure to catch any exceptions like `ValueError` or `ZeroDivisionError`.

## 📁VANITY_PLATES (problem set 2)

In Massachusetts, home to Harvard University, it’s possible to request a vanity license plate for your car, with your choice of letters and numbers instead of random ones. Among the requirements, though, are:

- “All vanity plates must start with at least two letters.”

- “… vanity plates may contain a maximum of 6 characters (letters or numbers) and a minimum of 2 characters.”

- “Numbers cannot be used in the middle of a plate; they must come at the end. For example, AAA222 would be an acceptable … vanity plate; AAA22A would not be acceptable. The first number used cannot be a ‘0’.”

- “No periods, spaces, or punctuation marks are allowed.”

In `plates.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a vanity plate and then output Valid if meets all of the requirements or Invalid if it does not.

## 📁CAMEL_CASE (problem set 2)

In some languages, it’s common to use camel case (otherwise known as “mixed case”) for variables’ names when those names comprise multiple words, whereby the first letter of the first word is lowercase but the first letter of each subsequent word is uppercase. For instance, whereas a variable for a user’s name might be called name, a variable for a user’s first name might be called firstName, and a variable for a user’s preferred first name (e.g., nickname) might be called preferredFirstName.

Python, by contrast, recommends snake case, whereby words are instead separated by underscores (\_), with all letters in lowercase. For instance, those same variables would be called name, first_name, and preferred_first_name, respectively, in Python.

In a file called `camel.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a variable in camel case and outputs the corresponding name in snake case. Assume that the user’s input will indeed be in camel case.

## 📁HOME_FEDERAL_SAVING_BANKS (problem set 1)

In season 7, episode 24 of Seinfeld, Kramer visits a bank that promises to give $100 to anyone who isn’t greeted with a “hello.” Kramer is instead greeted with a “hey,” which he insists isn’t a “hello,” and so he asks for $100. The bank’s manager proposes a compromise: “You got a greeting that starts with an ‘h,’ how does $20 sound?” Kramer accepts.

In a file called `bank.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with “hello”, output $0. If the greeting starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), output $20. Otherwise, output $100. Ignore any leading whitespace in the user’s greeting, and treat the user’s greeting case-insensitively.

## 📁FILE_EXTENSIONS (problem set 1)

In a file called `extensions.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a file and then outputs that file’s media type if the file’s name ends, case-insensitively, in any of these suffixes:

- .gif
- .jpg
- .jpeg
- .png
- .pdf
- .txt
- .zip

If the file’s name ends with some other suffix or has no suffix at all, output application/octet-stream instead, which is a common default.

## 📁PLAYBACK_SPEED (problem set 0)

Some people have a habit of lecturing speaking rather quickly, and it’d be nice to slow them down, a la YouTube’s 0.75 playback speed, or even by having them pause between words.

In a file called `playback.py`, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).

## 📁MAKING_FACES (problem set 0)

Before there were emoji, there were emoticons, whereby text like :) was a happy face and text like :( was a sad face. Nowadays, programs tend to convert emoticons to emoji automatically!

In a file called faces.py, implement a function called convert that accepts a str as input and returns that same input with any :) converted to 🙂 (otherwise known as a slightly smiling face) and any :( converted to 🙁 (otherwise known as a slightly frowning face). All other text should be returned unchanged.

Then, in that same file, implement a function called main that prompts the user for input, calls convert on that input, and prints the result. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input. Be sure to call main at the bottom of your file.

## 📁INDOOR (problem set 0)

In a file called `indoor.py`, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.
